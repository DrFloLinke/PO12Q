    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome!\nWelcome to “Introduction to Quantitative Political Analytics II”. This module builds on PO11Q and is primarily concerned with methods of bivariate and multivariate analysis. We start with cross-tabulations and build up slowly all the way to multivariate regression analysis, one of the most frequently used methods in social sciences.\nThis is the online companion to the seminars on PO12Q. The companion is structured very much in the same way as last term. But it introduces a new feature, called the “Weekly Code-Along”. Here, I walk you through an applied example in a short video to illustrate the method or technique we are covering in that respective week in R. Work through these sections either before you come to the seminar to get a bit of a head start, or after to consolidate the knowledge you have gained in the seminar.\nIn addition, you will find the following supplementary materials embedded throughout the companion:\n\nVideos that illustrate specific methods or techniques\nApplications that explore specific techniques in more detail\nFlashcards (with csv files) to learn the R functions used each week\n\nTo make working with the module’s material a little easier, I have produced the following resources which are available in the Downloads Section:\n\nA collection of Statistical Tables we will use\nA Formula Collection which contains all the formulae used on the module (you will receive an identical one in the exam, so there is no need to memorise anything)\nA complete bibliography of sources used for the module\n\nI hope you find it useful!\n\n \n\n\n\nCompanion Features\nYou will find embedded in the text five different types of boxes which serve different purposes:\n\nSome explanations that will hopefully make your work with this webpage or learning the material itself easier.\n\n\nA brief question which tests your understanding of the previous material.\n\n\nTo help you a bit along the way through the module, I have recorded a few videos.\n\n\nThis appears when you need to be careful with your coding in R to avoid problems.\n\n\nThis box appears whenever I want you to stop at a particular point in the worksheet and to flag up to me that you are done.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nThe companion uses the font “Lexend”. Lexend fonts are intended to reduce visual stress and so improve reading performance. Initially they were designed with dyslexia and struggling readers in mind, but Bonnie Shaver-Troup, creator of the Lexend project, soon found out that these fonts are also great for everyone else.\nCode is displayed in Recursive Mono. The font’s characters share the same width for clear legibility and perfect alignment. This is particularly helpful for use in programming and data-heavy design tasks, but also allows for creative possibilities in display typography.\nEquations and mathematical expressions are set in Fira Math. Fira Math is easy to read with open shapes, clear spacing, and good contrast. This keeps subscripts, superscripts, and fractions legible - even at small sizes. It stays readable on screens and in print, reducing mix-ups between look-alike characters like 1, I, and l.\nIf the three-column layout feels too busy, click the small text icon in the companion’s top-right to switch to Reader Mode. This streamlines the page and minimises the table of contents into a compact bar at the top.\nThe companion also uses a dark mode theme. For many users, including some neurodivergent individuals, dark mode can reduce eye strain and enhance focus by minimising visual overstimulation.\nWhilst I recognise that mobile phones play an essential part in all our daily lives, please note that this companion is optimised for display on tablets, laptops, and desktop computers.",

    "text": "Motivation1\nThe word “matrix” generally conjures up levels of horror in students which even Stephen King would be struggling to match2. And I have to admit that I have not always been best friends with them myself, either. But they are useful, and in their ability to convey a large amount of information in a structured and logical way, they are even beautiful. Because at the end of the day, a matrix is nothing more than a list.\nIn the lecture I introduced you to the following equation to describe an observation in a population:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\ny_{i} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{i} + \\epsilon_{i}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIf we wanted to write out this equation for every observation in our data set, it would look something like this:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    y_{1} &= \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{1} + \\epsilon_{1} \\\\\n    y_{2} &= \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{2} + \\epsilon_{2} \\\\\n    &\\vdots \\\\\n    y_{n} &= \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{n} + \\epsilon_{n}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis is incredibly wasteful, as it unnecessarily repeats notation. What we could do instead is to create a list which has as many columns as there are unique elements in these equations (since they all have the same structure), and only note the numeric values which actually change. And there you have a matrix:\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\pmb{y}\\)\n\n\n\\(=\\)\n\n\n\\(\\pmb{X}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\pmb{\\beta}\\)\n\n\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\\(\\pmb{\\epsilon}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\downarrow\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\downarrow\\)\n\n\n\\(\\downarrow\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\downarrow\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix}\n      y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n\n      \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\n\n=\n\n\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix}\n      1 & x_1 \\\\\n      1 & x_2 \\\\\n      \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n      1 & x_n\n      \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix}\n      \\beta_0 \\\\\n      \\beta_1\n      \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\n\n+\n\n\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix}\n      \\epsilon_1 \\\\\n      \\epsilon_2 \\\\\n      \\vdots \\\\\n      \\epsilon_n\n      \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that I have set the elements which refer to a matrix in bold. This is deliberate. Going forward we will distinguish between the following three types of elements:\n\nScalar\n\nA single numerical value, typically representing:\n\na constant (like \\(3\\), \\(\\pi\\), or \\(0.05\\)),\na parameter (like \\(\\beta_0\\)),\nor an individual data point (like \\(x_{i,j}\\) or \\(y_i\\)).\n\n\n\n\nVector\nA vector is a list of values arranged in a specific order. Most often, we write vectors as columns - meaning they have one value per row.\nKey properties:\n\nA vector is one column and multiple rows (a “column vector”).\nIt holds multiple values, but is still considered one object.\nWe use bold lowercase letters to name vectors: \\(\\pmb{x}\\), \\(\\pmb{y}\\), \\(\\pmb{\\hat{\\epsilon}}\\).\n\nExample:\nA column vector of residuals \\(\\pmb{\\hat{\\epsilon}}\\):\n\\[\n\\pmb{\\hat{\\epsilon}} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\hat{\\epsilon}_1 \\\\\n\\hat{\\epsilon}_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\hat{\\epsilon}_n\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\nMatrix\nA matrix is a rectangular table of numbers with rows and columns. It’s a way to organize data, equations, or systems neatly.\nKey properties:\n\nA matrix has multiple rows and multiple columns.\nWe write matrices in square brackets.\nThe size of a matrix is written as “rows × columns” (e.g., a 3 × 2 matrix has 3 rows and 2 columns).\nWe use bold uppercase letters to name matrices: \\(\\pmb{X}\\), \\(\\pmb{A}\\).\n\nExample:\nA \\(3 \\times 2\\) matrix \\(\\pmb{X}\\):\n\\[\n\\pmb{X} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_{11} & x_{12} \\\\\nx_{21} & x_{22} \\\\\nx_{31} & x_{32}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nWhilst we will be using all three in weeks to come, let us now focus on matrices. To show you how to work with matrices, let us define two matrices:\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\pmb{A}\n    =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n        1 & 7 & 3\\\\\n        9 & 5 & 4\\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\hspace{0.75cm}\n    \\pmb{B}\n    =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    6 & 3 & 8 & 2 \\\\\n    3 & 2 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n    1 & 5 & 3 & 9 \\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\\]",

We then add together these so-called inner products in order to arrive at \\(\\pmb{C}_{i,j}\\).

I would encourage you to watch it now.\n\nIf you can’t get enough of my delightful German accent, then I have some videos for you in which I go through the respective operation with matrices on screen. Here is the first:\nMultiplying Matrices\n\n\n\n\nAssume we are multiplying a 4x3 matrix with a 3x4 matrix with one another. How many rows and columns does the resulting matrix have?\n\n\n\nDividing Matrices\nIn order to be able to divide by an entire matrix, we take its inverse, and then multiply with the inverse3. We do the same in the non-matrix world. For example, if we wanted to divide 6 by 3, this is the same as multiplying 6 with \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), the inverse of 3. Sadly, inverting a matrix is not quite as straightforward as this. In fact, it is one of the most challenging operations you can do with a matrix. Luckily, the inversion of a 2 by 2 matrix (which is what we will be using) is still possible without a degree in algebra. The inverse \\(D^{-1}\\) of a 2 by 2 matrix \\(D\\) is defined as\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\pmb{D}^{-1} =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n        a & b \\\\\n        c & d \\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\n    =\n    \\frac{1}{ad - bc}\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n        d & -b \\\\\n        -c & a \\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nThus, to arrive at the inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix, we first have to form the fraction in front of it. This takes as its denominator the difference between the products of the diagonal elements. We also refer to the denominator as the determinant of the matrix. In a second step – now in the matrix itself – we swap a and d, and set a minus sign in front of b and c.\n\nDividing Matrices",

If a matrix is multiplied with \\(I\\), we receive the original matrix. For example let\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\pmb{I}\n    =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n    0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nIf we multiply \\(\\pmb{I}\\) with matrix \\(\\pmb{B}\\) we receive\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\pmb{I} \\times \\pmb{B}\n    =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n    0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\times\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    6 & 3 & 8 & 2 \\\\\n    3 & 2 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n    1 & 5 & 3 & 9 \\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    6 & 3 & 8 & 2 \\\\\n    3 & 2 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n    1 & 5 & 3 & 9 \\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nThis feature will be important in the derivation of estimators next week, where we will make use of the fact that a matrix multiplied with its inverse results in an identity matrix. For example \\(\\pmb{A} \\times \\pmb{A}^{-1} = \\pmb{I}\\)\n\nIdentity Matrix",

But let’s say we want to transform our variables, excluding all values over a certain point. For example, we want to exclude the values above 750 of our alcohol variable and above 500 for our mortality variable.\n\nThere are – of course – several solutions.

    "section": "Exporting the Results",
    "text": "Exporting the Results\nAs for the graphs, you can also export and save the results of the regression model in a Word table. To do that you can use the ‘modelsummary’ package.\nJust like writing a shopping list, we start by creating a list of models for which we want modelsummary to produce a table. You can merely list the names of the objects in which the models are stored, or you can give them specific names which will appear as column titles in the table. This addition is by no means a must, but sometimes you might wish to give models a particular name, for example if you have used different methods of estimation, different components of a theory, etc. In the table we are creating here, I wish to distinguish between bivariate and multivariate models. By default, modelsummary just numbers models in ascending order.\n\nmodels &lt;- list(\n  \"Bivariate\"    = model\n)\n\nThis simple step is already sufficient to produce – an admittedly somewhat crude – results table. All we have to do is to load the modelsummary package and to use the previously defined list of models as the argument of the modelsummary() function:\n\nlibrary(modelsummary)\nmodelsummary(models)\n\n\nExecute these code chunks as we go through this Section, so you can see the alterations we make to the table in real-time.\n\nThis table is a vast improvement on the raw R output you would receive when calling summary(model1). But it is far from finished. One characteristic which is conspicuously absent is an assessment of statistical significance. In model summaries of this kind this information is usually provided in the form of asterisks or other symbols next to the respective coefficient. We can add these simply by adding the option stars=TRUE to the code.\n\nmodelsummary(models,\n             stars = TRUE)\n\nNext up is the modification of the stub. The stub is the leftmost column in which you name the indicators for which coefficients will be presented.In the stub, “[a]bbreviate nothing. And never ever ever use computer variable names to stand for concepts. These are personal code words that convey no meaning to readers.” (Stimson, n.d., p. 10) Following this advice, let us add proper labels to the independent variables.\nTo let modelsummary know how to replace each variable name, we create a so-called coefficient map. This is really just a character vector which follows a “before-after” logic in each of its rows. For example 'age'='Age' replaces the variable name age with the label Age. We need to do this for all the variables we used in our models. I am storing this in a vecor called cm which stands for coefficient map.\n\ncm &lt;- c('ALCOHOL'    = 'Hospital stays related to alcohol use',\n        '(Intercept)' = 'Intercept')\n\nThe next step is easy, as we only need to feed this coefficient map into the modelsummary code with the option coef_map=cm:\n\nmodelsummary(models,\n             stars = TRUE,\n             coef_map = cm)\n\nThis is a personal thing, but I also like to show the label of the dependent variable in results tables. They just feel incomplete to me without this information. There is no default to achieve this in modelsummary and so we need to use a little trick.\nWhat I want to add in the first row, but only in the second columm, the text . This requires us to alter the style of the table slightly. modelsummary uses another package called tinytable to style the output. We load the package with library(tinytable) and instruct R to place the text where we want it.\n\nmodelsummary(models,\n             stars = TRUE,\n             coef_map = cm)|&gt;\n  group_tt(j = list(\"Dependent Variable: GCSE Score\" = 2))\n\nLastly, let us tackle the model fit statistics. By default, modelsummary prints a whole festival of these into the bottom section of the table, but I want to concentrate only on R\\(^2\\).\n\nmodelsummary(models,\n             stars = TRUE,\n             coef_map = cm,\n             gof_omit = 'DF|Deviance|Log.Lik|F|AIC|BIC|RMSE|Adj')|&gt;\n  group_tt(j = list(\"Dependent Variable: GCSE Score\" = 2))\n\nThis should produce Table 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n\n \nDependent Variable:GCSE Score\n\n              \n                 \n                Bivariate\n              \n        \n        + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.1, ** p &lt; 0.05, *** p &lt; 0.01\n        \n                \n                  Hospital stays related to alcohol use\n                  0.218***\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.005)\n                \n                \n                  Intercept\n                  76.734***\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.636)\n                \n                \n                  Num.Obs.\n                  6961\n                \n                \n                  R2\n                  0.245\n                \n        \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Regression Models\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can export your tables for use in MS Word, or Apple Pages.

The antisocx variable is part of module A and asks for a score from respondents on how much antisocial behaviour is in the neighbourhood. Previous research has suggested men perceive more antisocial behaviour in rural areas than urban areas.\n\nCreate a new data set for those who were chosen for the ‘A’ module. Call this crime.a.\nCreate a linear model using only male respondents from crime.a with the dependent variable antisocx and the independent variable rural2. Do your findings support previous research?\nTest the same model using only women. How do the two models differ?\n\nWe will now be using the full crime data frame. The wburgl variable asks respondents how worried they are about being burgled with answers ranging from “Very worried” to “Not at all worried” along with “Not applicable” and “Don’t know.”\n\n\nRecode those with “Not applicable” or “Don’t know” as NAs. b.Using agegrp7 and wburgl as continuous variables, test the hypothesis that older people are more worried about being burgled.\nUsing a dummy variable test whether those over 65 have are more worried about burglary then those who are younger.\nUsing dummies test whether any of the age groups differ significantly from the youngest age group.\nWhat does the intercept in each of the three models represent?",

If you skip this section, please make sure to do the exercises in the next section, as this taps into the variable transformations we explored in the lecture.\n\n\nThere are five variables which ask how worried the respondent is about being the victim of various crimes:\n\nCreate an additive variable called worry from these variables so that a score of 0 indicates the respondent answered all “Not at all worried” and a score of 15 indicates the respondent answered all “Very worried.” (Tip: Make sure to clean the variables for NAs).\nWhat are the mode, mean and median for worry?\nDescribe the variable educat3. How could it be modified to be used as a continuous variable?\nUsing educat3 as both a continuous and factor variable evaluate the statement “Worry about being a victim of crime is higher in those with lower education levels.”\nWhat are the \\(R^2\\) values for the two models calculated? Which is higher? Does this make that model better than the other?\nCalculate \\(97.5\\%\\) confidence intervals for the coefficients for those with GCSEs and those with Degrees.

    "text": "Working with the Classical Linear Assumptions\nTo help you understand the assumptions, I have written an application which illustrates how violations of key OLS regression assumptions affect estimation and inference.\n\n  Open Application      \n\nYou start by simulating a base dataset. In a second step, you apply one of these three common assumption violations:\n\nNonlinearity: the true relationship includes a quadratic term, but the fitted model is linear.\n\nHeteroskedasticity: the error variance increases with \\(x\\), so residuals spread out unevenly.\n\nCollinearity: predictors \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are highly correlated, making coefficient estimates unstable.\n\n\nHow to use the app\n\nChoose the sample size and the true coefficients (\\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\)) in the left panel.\n\nClick Simulate data to generate the base dataset.\n\nSelect a violation scenario and adjust its sliders to control severity.\n\nThe main plot shows the data, fitted line(s), and diagnostic curves.\n\nThe Diagnostics box reports statistical checks such as Breusch–Pagan, RESET, or VIF, depending on the scenario.\n\nThe Model comparison box contrasts the fitted equation with and without the violation.\n\nYou can reset everything with the Reset button and repeat with different settings to see how results vary.\n\n\nExercises with the app\n\nBase fit\nClick Simulate data with the scenario set to Base (no violation).\n\nWhat is the fitted line shown at the top of the plot?\n\nIs the estimated slope \\(\\hat\\beta_1\\) close to the “True \\(\\beta_1\\)” you set in the left panel? Briefly explain why it won’t be exactly equal.\n\nHeteroskedasticity on/off\nSwitch to Heteroscedasticity and set the slider to 0.\n\nWhat happens to the Breusch–Pagan (approx) p-value?\n\nIncrease the slider until a clear “bowtie” pattern appears. How do the SE (OLS) and SE (HC3) compare for the slope, and which p-value (OLS vs HC3) is more conservative?\n\nReading the bowtie guide\nWith heteroskedasticity turned up (non-zero), the dashed guide labeled “Error spread (\\(\\sigma\\))” is plotted.\n\nWhat does this curve represent in relation to \\(x\\)?\n\nHow does this relate to the Breusch–Pagan result you see in the diagnostics?\n\nFunctional form: keeping the same sample\nSwitch to Nonlinearity (functional form).\n\nSet \\(\\beta_2=0\\). What should the scatter and linear fit look like relative to the base sample?\n\nIncrease \\(\\beta_2\\) (positive). What visual change do you see, and what happens to the Linear vs quadratic (F-test) p-value?\n\nIf you set \\(\\beta_2&lt;0\\), how does the shape change and how should the RESET-style p-value respond?\n\nComparing linear vs quadratic coefficients\nIn the Nonlinearity diagnostics, inspect the table for the quadratic fit.\n\nWhich coefficient corresponds to curvature?\n\nWhen does it become statistically significant, and how does this align with the F-test and the overlayed dashed quadratic curve?\n\nMulticollinearity: creating instability\nSwitch to Collinearity (multivariate).\n\nIncrease \\(\\rho_{x}\\) close to 1. What happens to the VIF values in the diagnostics?\n\nIn the Model output pane, compare the estimate of \\(\\beta_1\\) “both \\(x_1\\) & \\(x_2\\)” vs “only \\(x_1\\)”. What does this illustrate about coefficient instability?\n\nWhy does collinearity mainly affect inference (SEs, stability) rather than introducing systematic bias?\n\nEquation comparison panel\nWith each scenario, read the Model comparison block (bottom-right card).\n\nFor Nonlinearity, why does the card display \\(\\hat y_{\\text{linear}}=\\hat\\beta_0+\\hat\\beta_1 x\\) instead of the quadratic?\n\nFor Collinearity, how is the model equation written, and what does that tell you about interpretation of \\(\\hat\\beta_{x_1}\\) and \\(\\hat\\beta_{x_2}\\)?",

    "text": "Full Glossary\n\n\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the definitions are taken from Linke (forthcoming).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nadjusted rsquared\nA version of R\\(^2\\) that adjusts for the number of independent variables in a multiple regression, providing a more unbiased estimate of the proportion of variance explained\n\n\nautocorrelation\nAutocorrelation occurs when the values of error terms are correlated across observations. No autocorrelation implies that the covariance between error terms is zero\n\n\nbinomial distribution\nA binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success.\n\n\ncategorical\nDescribing the qualitative categories of a characteristic, for example different religions\n\n\ncoefficient\nIn a regression model or equation, a coefficient is a numerical expression which is multiplied with the value of a variable\n\n\ncoefficient of determination\nIndicates the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable which is explained through the independent variable. It is defined as \\(\\frac{\\text{Explained Sum of Squares}}{\\text{Total Sum of Squares}}\\)\n\n\ncollinearity\nIf two variables are functionally dependent on each other we call these collinear. Should this apply to multiple variables at the same time we call these multi-collinear. (multi-)collinearity exists if – and only if – the values follow this function precisely. Such a situation is rare, as usually variables are more loosely related to one another\n\n\nconditional distributions\nThe number of subjects observed at all combinations of possible outcomes for the two (or more) categorical variables in the crosstabulation\n\n\nconditional expectation function\nsee Population Regression Function (PRF)\n\n\ncorrelation\nThe statistical dependence of two random variables which is determined by pairwise comparison of values\n\n\ncovariance\nA measure which assesses the degree to which the values of two variables (\\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\)) vary together (their joint variability).\n\n\ncrosstabulation\nCrosstabulations, or contingency tables, display the number of subjects observed at all combinations of possible outcomes for two (or more) categorical variables in matrix format\n\n\nderivative\nThe derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) at a point \\(a\\), denoted \\(f'(a)\\), is the slope of the tangent line to the function at that point. It measures the instantaneous rate of change of the function and is defined as: \\[f'(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}\\]\n\n\ndichotomous\nCan only assume two mutually exclusive, but internally homogeneous qualitative categories\n\n\ndifferentiation The process of finding the derivative of a function. The derivative measures how a function changes as its input changes - the instantaneous rate of change. We find it by taking the limit of the slope of secant lines as the two points get infinitesimally close together\nNA\n\n\ndummy variable\nDummy variables are dichotomous, categorical variables which indicate the presence or the absence of a characteristic.\n\n\nerror term\nThe error term quantifies the distance between each observation and the corresponding point on the regression line. The terms are denoted as \\(\\epsilon_{i}\\)\n\n\nheteroscedasticity\nThe variability of the error terms changes for different observations \\(X\\)\n\n\nhomoscedasticity\nRefers to a constant variance of the error terms\n\n\nindependent sample\nHere, the individuals or units in one sample do not influence or relate to those in the other sample. They’re from separate, unrelated groups. An example for a dependent sample would be the voter opinion before and after a debate, as we would be measuring the same individual twice.\n\n\nintercept\nThe intercept is the point at which the regression line intersects the y-axis. In this book we denote it as \\(\\beta_{0}\\)\n\n\nlaw of iterative expectations\nAccording to this law, “the expected value of X is equal to the expectationover the conditional expectation of X given Y” (Robinson, 2022)\n\n\nlogarithm\nLogarithm is defined as the exponent or power to which a base must be raised to yield a given number. Expressed mathematically, \\(x\\) is the logarithm of \\(n\\) to the base \\(b\\) if \\(b^x = n\\), in which case \\(x = log_b n\\) (Murray, 2023)\n\n\nmarginal distributions\nMarginal distributions in a crosstabulation refer to the totals for each row and column, showing the overall distribution of each variable separately, regardless of the other. They are found in the margins of the table and help summarize how each variable is distributed across all categories\n\n\nmatrix\nA matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. It is used to organize data or perform operations like transformations and systems of equations. Matrices are written in uppercase bold (e.g. \\(\\pmb{A}\\)) and can be added, multiplied, or inverted under certain conditions.\n\n\nmodel building\nRunning a number of regression models, each testing a different combination of variables.\n\n\nmulticollinearity\nA situation in which an independent variable is a function of multiple other independent variables in the regression model\n\n\nomitted variable bias\nIf you omit an important variable in a regression model, it will bias the size of other coefficients if the variables are correlated.\n\n\nOrdinary Least Squares\nThe method of fitting a regression line by means of minimizing the sum of the squared distances between the observations and the estimated values\n\n\nouter product\nThe outer product of two vectors results in a matrix in which each element is the product of corresponding elements from the first vector (rows) and the second vector (columns).\n\n\nparsimony\nRefers to the principle “as many as necessary, as few as possible”.\n\n\npartial slope coefficient\nA partial slope coefficient measures the influence of a variable in multiple regression, holding all other independent variables in the model constant\n\n\npolynomial\nA polynomial is a function of a variable \\(x\\) that can be written as a finite sum of powers of \\(x\\) multiplied by coefficients, for example \\[ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\cdots + \\beta_k x^k, \\] where \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer and the coefficients \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_k\\) are fixed constants\n\n\npooled standard error\nA combined estimate of the standard error across two or more groups, assuming they have equal variances, and is used when comparing group means\n\n\nPopulation Regression Function\nThe Population Regression Function (PRF) describes the expected distribution of \\(y\\), given the values of the independent variable(s) \\(x\\). It is also called the conditional expectation function (CEF) and can be denoted as \\(E(y_{i} \\mid x_{i})\\)\n\n\nreference category\nThe category of a dummy variable in respect to which the effect on the value of the dependent variable is displayed\n\n\nregression\nRegression analysis determines the direction and magnitude of influence of one or more independent variables on a dependent variable\n\n\nregression line\nThe regression line describes how the dependent variable is functionally related to the values of the independent variable. It it defined by the intercept \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and the slope \\(\\beta_{1}\\)\n\n\nresidual\nAn estimation of the error term. The difference between an observation \\(y_{i}\\) and the estimated value \\(\\hat{y}_{i}\\). Denoted as \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{i}\\)\n\n\nrobust standard errors\nAlso known as Huber-White standard errors, correct for heteroscedasticity by “[adjusting] the model-based standard errors using the empirical variability of the model residuals” (Mansournia et al., 2020, p. 347)\n\n\nSample Regression Function\nA regression line based on a randomly drawn sample\n\n\nscalar\nA scalar is a single numerical value used to represent magnitude. In linear algebra, it is typically written in lowercase italic (e.g. \\(a\\), \\(x\\)).\n\n\nsecant\nA straight line that intersects a curve at two or more points. The slope of a secant line gives the average rate of change between those points.\n\n\nslope\nA slope is defined as rise over run, and so it tells us how many units of y we need to climb (or descend if the slope is negative) for every additional unit of the independent variable \\(x\\)\n\n\nstatistical dependence\nStatistical dependence in crosstabulations refers to a situation where the distribution of one categorical variable varies across the levels of another. If the variables are dependent, knowing the value of one gives information about the other; if independent, the distribution of one remains consistent across all categories of the other\n\n\ntangent\nA straight line that touches a curve at exactly one point and has the same direction as the curve at that point. The slope of the tangent line gives the instantaneous rate of change at that point. The tangent line is the limit of secant lines as the two points get infinitely close together.\n\n\ntime-series data\nTime-series data review a certain characteristic over time \\(t\\), where \\(t\\) runs from 1 to \\(T\\)\n\n\nVariance-Covariance Matrix\nA variance-covariance matrix is a square matrix that encapsulates the variances of different variables on its diagonal and the covariances between pairs of variables in its off-diagonal elements. \n\n\nVariance Inflation Factor (VIF)\nA measure to quantify the how much larger the observed variance of a coefficient is compared to a scenario in which the variable was totally functionally independent from the other independent variables in the model\n\n\nvector\nA vector is a list of numbers arranged in a specific order, often as a column. It represents both magnitude and direction. In notation, vectors are written in lowercase bold (e.g. \\(\\pmb{x}\\)). Vectors are used to describe quantities like position, velocity, or coefficients in a regression model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Glossary for PO12Q\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinke, F. (forthcoming).

Where there is a choice of sections to answer, you must indicate on the front cover which section is answered. You must indicate your Seat Number and Student ID on the exam booklet.",

In the first instance you may just be taken outside the hall to see if a small break will help. If you are not starting to feel better and need medical attendance, then the invigilator will contact relevant colleagues.",

You may be taking your exam in a room with 200-300 people, so please bear in mind there may be a delay as we can only take one person at a time. We will be keeping a log of everyone that is escorted to the toilet.",

They will convey your question to the teaching team and get back to you. This may take a while so keep working on your exam, so you do not waste time waiting for an answer. It is very likely the invigilator will return and say there is no error and ask you to proceed with your interpretation of the question. If there is indeed an error, there will be an announcement made to all students. If you have already answered the question when the announcement of any error is indicated, do not go back and redo the question, rather note on the answer booklet alongside the relevant question that you completed the question prior to the announcement.",

You will likely take your exam in a room with 200-300 people, so please be patient until all exam papers have been collected. Only then will you be allowed to leave the room in silence as other students may still be sitting their exams for other modules.",
