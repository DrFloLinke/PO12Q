    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome!\nThis is the online companion to the seminars on PO12Q. The companion is structured very much in the same way as last term. But it introduces a new ‚ÄúMethods, Methods, Methods‚Äù feature. Here, I walk you through a an applied example in a short video to illustrate the method or technique we are covering in that respective week in R. Work through these sections before you come to the seminar to get a bit of a head start, or after to consolidate the knowledge you have gained in the seminar.\nI hope you find it useful!\n\n \n\n\n\nCompanion Features\nYou will find embedded in the text five different types of boxes which serve different purposes:\n\nSome explanations that will hopefully make your work with this webpage or learning the material itself easier.\n\n\nA brief question which tests your understanding of the previous material.\n\n\nTo help you a bit along the way through the module, I have recorded a few videos.\n\n\nThis appears when you need to be careful with your coding in R to avoid problems.\n\n\nThis box appears whenever I want you to stop at a particular point in the worksheet and to flag up to me that you are done.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nThe companion uses the font ‚ÄúLexend‚Äù. Lexend fonts are intended to reduce visual stress and so improve reading performance. Initially they were designed with dyslexia and struggling readers in mind, but Bonnie Shaver-Troup, creator of the Lexend project, soon found out that these fonts are also great for everyone else.\nCode is displayed in Recursive Mono. The font‚Äôs characters share the same width for clear legibility and perfect alignment. This is particularly helpful for use in programming and data-heavy design tasks, but also allows for creative possibilities in display typography.\nEquations and mathematical expressions are set in Fira Math. Fira Math is easy to read with open shapes, clear spacing, and good contrast. This keeps subscripts, superscripts, and fractions legible - even at small sizes. It stays readable on screens and in print, reducing mix-ups between look-alike characters like 1, I, and l.\nIf the three-column layout feels too busy, click the small text icon in the companion‚Äôs top-right to switch to Reader Mode. This streamlines the page and minimises the table of contents into a compact bar at the top.\nThe companion also uses a dark mode theme. For many users, including some neurodivergent individuals, dark mode can reduce eye strain and enhance focus by minimising visual overstimulation.\nWhilst I recognise that mobile phones play an essential part in all our daily lives, please note that this companion is optimised for display on tablets, laptops, and desktop computers.",

    "text": "Motivation1\nThe word ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù generally conjures up levels of horror in students which even Stephen King would be struggling to match2. And I have to admit that I have not always been best friends with them myself, either. But they are useful, and in their ability to convey a large amount of information in a structured and logical way, they are even beautiful. Because at the end of the day, a matrix is nothing more than a list.\nIn the lecture I introduced you to the concept of the Population Regression Function (PRF) which can be written as:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\ny_{i} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{i} + \\epsilon_{i}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIf we wanted to write out this equation for every observation in our data set, it would look something like this:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    y_{1} &= \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{1} + \\epsilon_{1} \\\\\n    y_{2} &= \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{2} + \\epsilon_{2} \\\\\n    &\\vdots \\\\\n    y_{n} &= \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{n} + \\epsilon_{n}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis is incredibly wasteful, as it unnecessarily repeats notation. What we could do instead is to create a list which has as many columns as there are unique elements in these equations (since they all have the same structure), and only note the numeric values which actually change. And there you have a matrix:\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\pmb{y}\\)\n\n\n\\(=\\)\n\n\n\\(\\pmb{X}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\pmb{\\beta}\\)\n\n\n\\(+\\)\n\n\n\\(\\pmb{\\epsilon}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\downarrow\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\downarrow\\)\n\n\n\\(\\downarrow\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\downarrow\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix}\n      y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n\n      \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\n\n=\n\n\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix}\n      1 & x_1 \\\\\n      1 & x_2 \\\\\n      \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n      1 & x_n\n      \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix}\n      \\beta_0 \\\\\n      \\beta_1\n      \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\n\n+\n\n\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix}\n      \\epsilon_1 \\\\\n      \\epsilon_2 \\\\\n      \\vdots \\\\\n      \\epsilon_n\n      \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that I have set the elements which refer to a matrix in bold. This is deliberate. Going forward we will distinguish between the following three types of elements:\n\nScalar\n\nA single numerical value, typically representing:\n\na constant (like \\(3\\), \\(\\pi\\), or \\(0.05\\)),\na parameter (like \\(\\beta_0\\)),\nor an individual data point (like \\(x_{i,j}\\) or \\(y_i\\)).\n\n\n\n\nVector\nA vector is a list of values arranged in a specific order. Most often, we write vectors as columns - meaning they have one variable per row.\nKey properties:\n\nA vector is one column and multiple rows (a ‚Äúcolumn vector‚Äù).\nIt holds multiple values, but is still considered one object.\nWe use bold lowercase letters to name vectors: \\(\\pmb{x}\\), \\(\\pmb{y}\\), \\(\\pmb{\\epsilon}\\).\n\nExample:\nA column vector of residuals \\(\\pmb{\\epsilon}\\):\n\\[\n\\pmb{\\epsilon} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\epsilon_1 \\\\\n\\epsilon_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\epsilon_n\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\nMatrix\nA matrix is a rectangular table of numbers with rows and columns. It‚Äôs a way to organize data, equations, or systems neatly.\nKey properties:\n\nA matrix has multiple rows and multiple columns.\nWe write matrices in square brackets.\nThe size of a matrix is written as ‚Äúrows √ó columns‚Äù (e.g., a 3 √ó 2 matrix has 3 rows and 2 columns).\nWe use bold uppercase letters to name matrices: \\(\\pmb{X}\\), \\(\\pmb{A}\\).\n\nExample:\nA \\(3 \\times 2\\) matrix \\(\\pmb{X}\\):\n\\[\n\\pmb{X} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_{11} & x_{12} \\\\\nx_{21} & x_{22} \\\\\nx_{31} & x_{32}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nWhilst we will be using all three in weeks to come, let us now focus on matrices. To show you how to work with matrices, let us define two matrices:\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\pmb{A}\n    =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n        1 & 7 & 3\\\\\n        9 & 5 & 4\\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\hspace{0.75cm}\n    \\pmb{B}\n    =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    6 & 3 & 8 & 2 \\\\\n    3 & 2 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n    1 & 5 & 3 & 9 \\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\\]",

I would encourage you to watch it now.\n\nIf you can‚Äôt get enough of my delightful German accent, then I have some videos for you in which I go through the respective operation with matrices on screen. Here is the first:\nMultiplying Matrices\n\n\n\n\nAssume we are multiplying a 4x3 matrix with a 3x4 matrix with one another. How many rows and columns does the resulting matrix have?\n\n\n\nDividing Matrices\nIn order to be able to divide by an entire matrix, we take its inverse, and then multiply with the inverse3. We do the same in the non-matrix world. For example, if we wanted to divide 6 by 3, this is the same as multiplying 6 with \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), the inverse of 3. Sadly, inverting a matrix is not quite as straightforward as this. In fact, it is one of the most challenging operations you can do with a matrix. Luckily, the inversion of a 2 by 2 matrix (which is what we will be using) is still possible without a degree in algebra. The inverse \\(D^{-1}\\) of a 2 by 2 matrix \\(D\\) is defined as\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\pmb{D}^{-1} =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n        a & b \\\\\n        c & d \\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\n    =\n    \\frac{1}{ad - bc}\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n        d & -b \\\\\n        -c & a \\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nThus, to arrive at the inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix, we first have to form the fraction in front of it. This takes as its denominator the difference between the products of the diagonal elements. We also refer to the denominator as the determinant of the matrix. In a second step ‚Äì now in the matrix itself ‚Äì we swap a and d, and set a minus sign in front of b and c.\n\nDividing Matrices",

If a matrix is multiplied with \\(I\\), we receive the original matrix. For example let\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\pmb{I}\n    =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n    0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nIf we multiply \\(\\pmb{I}\\) with matrix \\(\\pmb{B}\\) we receive\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\pmb{I} \\times \\pmb{B}\n    =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n    0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\times\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    6 & 3 & 8 & 2 \\\\\n    3 & 2 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n    1 & 5 & 3 & 9 \\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    6 & 3 & 8 & 2 \\\\\n    3 & 2 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n    1 & 5 & 3 & 9 \\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nThis feature will be important in the derivation of estimators next week, where we will make use of the fact that a matrix multiplied with its inverse results in an identity matrix. For example \\(\\pmb{A} \\times \\pmb{A}^{-1} = \\pmb{I}\\)\n\nIdentity Matrix",

Error  t value Pr(&gt;|t|)\n(Intercept) 76.7336534 0.636021422 120.6463        0\nALCOHOL      0.2176351 0.004579103  47.5279        0\n\n\n\nAs you go through the different numbers, take note which component of the regression output is associated with which number.",

    "text": "Exporting the Results\nAs for the graphs, you can also export and save the results of the regression model in a Word table. To do that you can use the ‚Äòmodelsummary‚Äô package.\nJust like writing a shopping list, we start by creating a list of models for which we want modelsummary to produce a table. You can merely list the names of the objects in which the models are stored, or you can give them specific names which will appear as column titles in the table. This addition is by no means a must, but sometimes you might wish to give models a particular name, for example if you have used different methods of estimation, different components of a theory, etc. In the table we are creating here, I wish to distinguish between bivariate and multivariate models. By default, modelsummary just numbers models in ascending order.\n\nmodels &lt;- list(\n  \"Bivariate\"    = model\n)\n\nThis simple step is already sufficient to produce ‚Äì an admittedly somewhat crude ‚Äì results table. All we have to do is to load the modelsummary package and to use the previously defined list of models as the argument of the modelsummary() function:\n\nlibrary(modelsummary)\nmodelsummary(models)\n\n\nExecute these code chunks as we go through this Section, so you can see the alterations we make to the table in real-time.\n\nThis table is a vast improvement on the raw R output you would receive when calling summary(model1). But it is far from finished. One characteristic which is conspicuously absent is an assessment of statistical significance. In model summaries of this kind this information is usually provided in the form of asterisks or other symbols next to the respective coefficient. We can add these simply by adding the option stars=TRUE to the code.\n\nmodelsummary(models,\n             stars = TRUE)\n\nNext up is the modification of the stub. The stub is the leftmost column in which you name the indicators for which coefficients will be presented.In the stub, ‚Äú[a]bbreviate nothing. And never ever ever use computer variable names to stand for concepts. These are personal code words that convey no meaning to readers.‚Äù (Stimson, n.d., p. 10) Following this advice, let us add proper labels to the independent variables.\nTo let modelsummary know how to replace each variable name, we create a so-called coefficient map. This is really just a character vector which follows a ‚Äúbefore-after‚Äù logic in each of its rows. For example 'age'='Age' replaces the variable name age with the label Age. We need to do this for all the variables we used in our models. I am storing this in a vecor called cm which stands for coefficient map.\n\ncm &lt;- c('idaci'    = 'Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index',\n        '(Intercept)' = 'Intercept')\n\nThe next step is easy, as we only need to feed this coefficient map into the modelsummary code with the option coef_map=cm:\n\nmodelsummary(models,\n             stars = TRUE,\n             coef_map = cm)\n\nThis is a personal thing, but I also like to show the label of the dependent variable in results tables. They just feel incomplete to me without this information. There is no default to achieve this in modelsummary and so we need to use a little trick.\nWhat I want to add in the first row, but only in the second columm, the text . This requires us to alter the style of the table slightly. modelsummary uses another package called tinytable to style the output. We load the package with library(tinytable) and instruct R to place the text where we want it.\n\nlibrary(tinytable)\nmodelsummary(models,\n             stars = TRUE,\n             coef_map = cm)|&gt;\n  group_tt(j = list(\"Dependent Variable: GCSE Score\" = 2))\n\nLastly, let us tackle the model fit statistics. By default, modelsummary prints a whole festival of these into the bottom section of the table, but I want to concentrate only on R\\(^2\\).\n\nmodelsummary(models,\n             stars = TRUE,\n             coef_map = cm,\n             gof_omit = 'DF|Deviance|Log.Lik|F|AIC|BIC|RMSE')|&gt;\n  group_tt(j = list(\"Dependent Variable: GCSE Score\" = 2))\n\nThis should produce Table¬†2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n\n \nDependent Variable:GCSE Score\n\n        \n              \n                 \n                Bivariate\n              \n        \n        + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.1, ** p &lt; 0.05, *** p &lt; 0.01\n        \n                \n                  Intercept\n                  76.734***\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.636)\n                \n        \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\nTable¬†2: Regression Models\n\n\n\n\nYou can export your tables for use in MS Word, or Apple Pages. But you will not be able to export the full table, only up to the point at which you are specifying the options for tinytable with |&gt;. This is probably as good a reason as any to start working with Markdown or LaTeXBut if you are happy with this caveat, the following code will render the table in an MS Word document (output=\"table.docx\") that is placed in your working directory.\n\nmodelsummary(models,\n             stars = TRUE,\n             coef_map = cm,\n             gof_omit = 'AIC|BIC|Log.Lik|F|RMSE',\n             output = \"table.docx\")",

The antisocx variable is part of module A and asks for a score from respondents on how much antisocial behaviour is in the neighbourhood. Previous research has suggested men perceive more antisocial behaviour in rural areas than urban areas.\n\nCreate a new data set for those who were chosen for the ‚ÄòA‚Äô module. Call this crime.a.\nCreate a linear model using only male respondents from crime.a with the dependent variable antisocx and the independent variable rural2. Do your findings support previous research?\nTest the same model using only women. How do the two models differ?\n\nWe will now be using the full crime data frame. The wburgl variable asks respondents how worried they are about being burgled with answers ranging from ‚ÄúVery worried‚Äù to ‚ÄúNot at all worried‚Äù along with ‚ÄúNot applicable‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know.‚Äù\n\n\nRecode those with ‚ÄúNot applicable‚Äù or ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know‚Äù as NAs. b.Using agegrp7 and wburgl as continuous variables, test the hypothesis that older people are more worried about being burgled.\nUsing a dummy variable test whether those over 65 have are more worried about burglary then those who are younger.\nUsing dummies test whether any of the age groups differ significantly from the youngest age group.\nWhat does the intercept in each of the three models represent?",

    "section": "(Multi-)Collinearity1",
    "text": "(Multi-)Collinearity1\nIn this Section, we will be testing for collinearity. We can do so with correlation analysis, which assesses to what degree two variables vary together. As such, this method is limited to pairwise comparisons between variables. It is conceivable, and indeed often the case, however, that one variable is functionally related to two or more other independent variables, such as\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    x_{1,i} = 0.2 x_{2,i }- 1.7 x_{3,i}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nWe refer to this situation as multicollinearity. In order to detect it, we need to test for the functional dependence of each independent variable on the remaining independent variables in the model. We can do so by employing secondary regression models, not unlike in the Breusch-Pagan Test (see lecture slides). We specify K secondary regression models, each adopting one of our K independent variables as its dependent variable. Let us specify such a function for \\(x_1\\):\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\nx_{1,i} = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 x_{2,i} + \\alpha_2 x_{3,i} + ... + \\alpha_{k-1} x_{k,i} + v_i\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) denotes our new regression coefficients, and \\(v_i\\) represents a random error term. For the remaining independent variables, the functions would look as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    x_{2,i} &= \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 x_{1,i} + \\alpha_2 x_{3,i} + \\alpha_3 x_{4,i} + ... + \\alpha_{k-1} x_{k,i} + v_i \\\\\n    x_{3,i} &= \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 x_{1,i} + \\alpha_2 x_{2,i} + \\alpha_3 x_{4,i} + ... + \\alpha_{k-1} x_{k,i} + v_i \\\\\n    \\vdots \\\\\n    x_{k,i} &= \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 x_{1,i} + \\alpha_2 x_{2,i} + \\alpha_3 x_{3,i} + ... + \\alpha_{k-1} x_{k-1,i} + v_i\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIn order to quantify how well each of the K regression functions explains the respective independent variable, we are going to use Adjusted R-Squared. We will note the \\(\\bar{R}^2\\) of each individual regression as \\(\\bar{R}_j^2\\) where j runs from 1 to k, or \\(j=1,...,k\\).\n\\(\\bar{R}_j^2\\) in itself already provides useful information, but we can do better than this. We can use \\(\\bar{R}_j^2\\) to develop a measure which tells us how much larger the observed variance of a coefficient is compared to a scenario in which the variable was totally functionally independent from the other independent variables in the model. We call this measure variance inflation factor and define it as follows:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\text{VIF}_j = \\frac{1}{1-\\bar{R}_j^2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIts size is solely determined by \\(\\bar{R}_j^2\\). The better a model explains the respective independent variable, the closer \\(\\bar{R}_j^2\\) will be to one, increasing the size of VIF\\(_j\\). A commonly adopted threshold for classing a variable as (multi-)collinear is VIF=10. This threshold is completely arbitrary, but has nonetheless managed to establish itself in regression analysis.\nWe will now use london_sam data frame to put theory into practice.\n\nRegress GCSE scores on and in a multiple regression model. Interpret the results.\n\n\nmodel3 &lt;- lm(gcse ~ income + idaci, data=london_sam)\n\n\nInstall and load the package.\n\n\nlibrary(car)\n\n\nCalculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for this model as follows:\n\n\nvif(model3)\n\n\nInterpret the results.\nRegress GCSE scores on houseprice. Store the results in an object called model4. Note the significance of the slope coefficient and interpret the results.\nLet‚Äôs introduce some collinearity by estimating the following model:\n\n\nmodel5 &lt;- lm(gcse ~ income + houseprice, data=london_sam)\n\n\nCalculate the VIF for model 5. Interpret the results.\nDrawing on the results of Exercise 7, explain the significance of the slope coefficients of Model 1 (Exercise 3 in the previous section) and Model 4 (Exercise 6 of this section).",

As such their covariances must be zero\n\n\nbinomial distribution\nA binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success.\n\n\ncategorical\nDescribing the qualitative categories of a characteristic, for example different religions\n\n\ncoefficient\nA coefficient is a numerical expression which is multiplied with the value of a variable\n\n\ncoefficient of determination\nIndicates the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable which is explained through the independent variable. It is defined as \\(\\frac{\\text{Explained Sum of Squares}}{\\text{Total Sum of Squares}}\\)\n\n\ncollinearity\nIf two variables are functionally dependent on each other we call these collinear. Should this apply to multiple variables at the same time we call these multi-collinear. (multi-)collinearity exists if ‚Äì and only if ‚Äì the values follow this function precisely. Such a situation is rare, as usually variables are more loosely related to one another\n\n\nconditional distributions\nThe number of subjects observed at all combinations of possible outcomes for the two (or more) categorical variables in the crosstabulation\n\n\nconditional expectation function\nsee Population Regression Function (PRF)\n\n\ncorrelation\nThe statistical dependence of two random variables which is determined by pairwise comparison of values\n\n\ncovariance\nA measure which assesses the degree to which the values of two variables (\\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\)) vary together (their joint variability).\n\n\ncrosstabulation\nCrosstabulations, or contingency tables, display the number of subjects observed at all combinations of possible outcomes for two (or more) categorical variables in matrix format\n\n\ndichotomous\nCan only assume two mutually exclusive, but internally homogeneous qualitative categories\n\n\ndummy variable\nDummy variables are dichotomous, categorical variables which indicate the presence or the absence of a characteristic.\n\n\nerror term\nThe error term quantifies the distance between each observation and the corresponding point on the regression line. The terms are denoted as \\(\\epsilon_{i}\\)\n\n\nheteroscedasticity\nThe variability of the error terms changes for different observations \\(X\\)\n\n\nhomoscedasticity\nRefers to a constant variance of the error terms\n\n\nindependent sample\nHere, the individuals or units in one sample do not influence or relate to those in the other sample. They‚Äôre from separate, unrelated groups. An example for a dependent sample would be the voter opinion before and after a debate, as we would be measuring the same individual twice.\n\n\nintercept\nThe intercept is the point at which the regression line intersects the y-axis. In this book we denote it as \\(\\beta_{0}\\)\n\n\nlaw of iterative expectations\nAccording to this law, ‚Äúthe expected value of X is equal to the expectationover the conditional expectation of X given Y‚Äù (Robinson, 2022)\n\n\nlogarithm\nLogarithm is defined as the exponent or power to which a base must be raised to yield a given number. Expressed mathematically, \\(x\\) is the logarithm of \\(n\\) to the base \\(b\\) if \\(b^x = n\\), in which case \\(x = log_b n\\) (Murray, 2023)\n\n\nmarginal distributions\nMarginal distributions in a crosstabulation refer to the totals for each row and column, showing the overall distribution of each variable separately, regardless of the other. They are found in the margins of the table and help summarize how each variable is distributed across all categories\n\n\nmatrix\nA matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. It is used to organize data or perform operations like transformations and systems of equations. Matrices are written in uppercase bold (e.g.¬†\\(\\pmb{A}\\)) and can be added, multiplied, or inverted under certain conditions.\n\n\nmodel building\nRunning a number of regression models, each testing a different combination of variables.\n\n\nmulticollinearity\nA situation in which an independent variable is a function of multiple other independent variables in the regression model\n\n\nomitted variable bias\nIf you omit an important variable in a regression model, it will bias the size of other coefficients if the variables are correlated.\n\n\nOrdinary Least Squares\nThe method of fitting a regression line by means of minimizing the sum of the squared distances between the observations and the estimated values\n\n\nouter product\nThe outer product of two vectors results in a matrix in which each element is the product of corresponding elements from the first vector (rows) and the second vector (columns).\n\n\nparsimony\nRefers to the principle ‚Äúas many as necessary, as few as possible‚Äù.\n\n\npartial slope coefficient\nA partial slope coefficient measures the influence of a variable in multiple regression, holding all other independent variables in the model constant\n\n\npooled standard error\nA combined estimate of the standard error across two or more groups, assuming they have equal variances, and is used when comparing group means\n\n\nPopulation Regression Function\nThe Population Regression Function (PRF) describes the expected distribution of \\(y\\), given the values of the independent variable(s) \\(x\\). It is also called the conditional expectation function (CEF) and can be denoted as \\(E(y_{i} \\mid x_{i})\\)\n\n\nreference category\nThe category of a dummy variable in respect to which the effect on the value of the dependent variable is displayed\n\n\nregression\nRegression analysis determines the direction and magnitude of influence of one or more independent variables on a dependent variable\n\n\nregression line\nThe regression line describes how the dependent variable is functionally related to the values of the independent variable. It it defined by the intercept \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and the slope \\(\\beta_{1}\\)\n\n\nresidual\nAn estimation of the error term. The difference between an observation \\(y_{i}\\) and the estimated value \\(\\hat{y}_{i}\\). Denoted as \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{i}\\)\n\n\nrobust standard errors\nAlso known as Huber-White standard errors, correct for heteroscedasticity by ‚Äú[adjusting] the model-based standard errors using the empirical variability of the model residuals‚Äù (Mansournia et al., 2020, p. 347)\n\n\nSample Regression Function\nA regression line based on a randomly drawn sample\n\n\nscalar\nA scalar is a single numerical value used to represent magnitude. In linear algebra, it is typically written in lowercase italic (e.g.¬†\\(a\\), \\(x\\)).\n\n\nslope\nA slope is defined as rise over run, and so it tells us how many units of y we need to climb (or descend if the slope is negative) for every additional unit of the independent variable \\(x\\)\n\n\nstatistical dependence\nStatistical dependence in crosstabulations refers to a situation where the distribution of one categorical variable varies across the levels of another. If the variables are dependent, knowing the value of one gives information about the other; if independent, the distribution of one remains consistent across all categories of the other\n\n\ntime-series data\nTime-series data review a certain characteristic over time \\(t\\), where \\(t\\) runs from 1 to \\(T\\)\n\n\nVariance-Covariance Matrix\nA variance-covariance matrix is a square matrix that encapsulates the variances of different variables on its diagonal and the covariances between pairs of variables in its off-diagonal elements.¬†\n\n\nVariance Inflation Factor (VIF)\nA measure to quantify the how much larger the observed variance of a coefficient is compared to a scenario in which the variable was totally functionally independent from the other independent variables in the model\n\n\nvector\nA vector is a list of numbers arranged in a specific order, often as a column. It represents both magnitude and direction. In notation, vectors are written in lowercase bold (e.g.¬†\\(\\pmb{x}\\)). Vectors are used to describe quantities like position, velocity, or coefficients in a regression model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†1: Glossary for PO12Q\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMansournia, M.
