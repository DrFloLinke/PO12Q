First up is Recoding: as a refresher from PO11Q, we are specifying the new data frame as the old one, then we add a pipe, and call the function . Therein, we create a new variable called , which will be an ordered factor, cutting the variable at the stated intervals, and labeling these levels accordingly. library(tidyverse) wdi &lt;- wdi %&gt;% mutate(lifecat= ordered( cut(lifeexp, breaks=c(0,77,84), labels=c(&quot;low&quot;,&quot;high&quot;)))) Next up is which we are recoding into a factor variable with three levels: wdi &lt;- wdi %&gt;% mutate(gdpcat= ordered( cut(gdppc, breaks=c(0,3861.5,25260, 150000), labels=c(&quot;low&quot;,&quot;medium&quot;, &quot;high&quot;)))) Let us now see whether the level of GDP has an influence on life expectancy State the null and the alternative hypothesis (directional) Run the cross-tabulation, by calling: wdi_table &lt;- with(wdi, table(gdpcat, lifecat)) wdi_table lifecat gdpcat low high low 69 0 medium 54 16 high 3 27 Now perform a chi-squared test, using the command2 Xsq &lt;- chisq.test(wdi_table, correct=FALSE) Xsq Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test data: wdi_table X-squared = 89.702, df = 2, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 Are the results statistically significant?

State the null and directional alternative hypothesis for this test. Create a new variable primary_fac using the prim_compl variable. Cut it into three categories “low”, “medium”, and “high”, cutting prim_compl at its first quartile, and its mean. Apply the same procedure to unemploy, creating a new variable called unemp_fac.

Give an example for a two-sample test for a proportion. Why do we calculate the t-score as \\(t =\\frac{\\text{Estimate of parameter - null hypothesis value of parameter}}{\\text{Standard error of estimate}}\\) ? What is the difference between a t-score and a z-score? What are the strengths and weaknesses of two-sample tests? 0.6 Two-Sample Tests in R 0.6.1 Data Preparation We are working with the World Development Indicators again. Data are taken from World Bank (2020), Boix et al. (2018), and Marshall &amp; Gurr (2020). To save you rooting in your files, here is the codebook (you are welcome): Load the data set The Polity V Score (variable polity5) codes regimes from -10 (indicating perfect autocracy) to +10 (indicating perfect democracy). With the tidyvserse, create a new variable called democracy which codes all countries with a Polity V score lower than +1 as dictatorships, and all countries with a Polity V score from +1 to +10 as democracies. Apply the same procedure to gdp, cutting it at its median into two levels, Developing and Developed, creating a new variable called gdpcat. Last up is the variable gdpgrowth. Create a new variable called growth which divides countries into “slow-growing” and “fast-growing” countries, using the mean as the cut-off point. 0.6.2 Guided Example – Two-Sample Test for a Proportion Let us find out whether a higher proportion of developed countries is democratic than developing countries. State the null hypothesis and the directional alternative hypothesis for this research question. In order to test this hypothesis, we need to first create a cross-tabulation: table(wdi$gdpcat, wdi$politybin) Dictatorship Democracy Developing 21 36 Developed 19 71 We now take the number of observations which are classed as democracies per development status. We also calculate the row totals, as this gives us the total number of developing and developed countries, respectively. Then we are ready to use the prop.test() command, by first specifying the number of countries which are democracies, then the total number of developing and developed countries, then advising R that a correction for small sample sizes is not necessary in our case. Our hypothesis is directional, because we expect a higher proportion of developed countries to be democratic than developing countries. The status Developing is the lower category, and we thus expect this proportion to be smaller, or “less”. We add this to the test function as option alternative = \"less\". prop.test(c(36,71),c(57,90), correct=F, alternative = &quot;less&quot;) 2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction data: c(36, 71) out of c(57, 90) X-squared = 4.3602, df = 1, p-value = 0.01839 alternative hypothesis: less 95 percent confidence interval: -1.00000000 -0.03061662 sample estimates: prop 1 prop 2 0.6315789 0.7888889 Which proportion of developing and developed countries are democratic? Do we verify or falsify our hypothesis at a 95% confidence level? 0.6.3 Exercise – Two-Sample Test for a Proportion Is a higher proportion of fast-growing countries democratic than slow-growing countries? Use a 95% confidence level. 0.6.4 Guided Example – Two-Sample Test for a Mean Now we are interested whether people live longer in developed countries than in developing countries? For this, we use the variable life Once again, state the Null- and the Alternative Hypothesis The t-test assumes an equal variance in both samples, and so we need to test whether this is the case. We will do this with the so-called Levene Test, where: \\(H_{0}\\): The variance among the groups is equal. \\(H_{A}\\): The variance among the groups is not equal. For the Levene test you need the package, where “car” stands for “Companion to Applied Regression”: install.packages(&quot;car&quot;) Now we call the package and perform the test: library(car) leveneTest(wdi$lifeexp ~ wdi$gdpcat) Levene&#39;s Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median) Df F value Pr(&gt;F) group 1 3.7671 0.05395 . 167 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 The result is insignificant, and we therefore accept the null hypothesis. This means that the variance in the two samples is equal. Now we can perform the t-test. We once again specify alternative=\"less\" as an option, due to the same reasoning as before. t.test(lifeexp ~ gdpcat, data=wdi, var.equal = TRUE, alternative=&quot;less&quot;) Two Sample t-test data: lifeexp by gdpcat t = -12.01, df = 167, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Developing and group Developed is less than 0 95 percent confidence interval: -Inf -9.53028 sample estimates: mean in group Developing mean in group Developed 64.65938 75.71177 Can we conclude at a 95% confidence level, that people live longer in developed countries than in developing countries? 0.6.5 Exercise – Two-Sample Test for a Mean Do people live longer under democracies than under dictatorahips (use the politybin variable)? Use a 95% confidence level. 0.7 Solutions You can find the Solutions in the Downloads Section. Some of the content of this worksheet is taken from Reiche (forthcoming).↩︎ "],["introduction-to-matrices.html", "Introduction to Matrices 0.8 What is a Matrix?4 0.9 Matrix Notation 0.10 Calculating with Matrices 0.11 Special Matrices", " Introduction to Matrices 0.8 What is a Matrix?4 The word “matrix” generally conjures up levels of horror in students which even Stephen King would be struggling to match5. And I have to admit that I have not always been best friends with them myself, either. But they are useful, and in their ability to convey a large amount of information in a structured and logical way, they are even beautiful. Because at the end of the day, a matrix is nothing more than a list. In the lecture I introduced you to the concept of the Population Regression Function (PRF) which can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} y_{i} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{i} + \\epsilon_{i} \\end{equation}\\] If we wanted to write out this equation for every observation in our data set, it would look something like this: \\[\\begin{align*} y_{1} &amp;= \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{1} + \\epsilon_{1} \\\\ y_{2} &amp;= \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{2} + \\epsilon_{2} \\\\ &amp;\\vdots \\\\ y_{n} &amp;= \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{n} + \\epsilon_{n} \\end{align*}\\] This is incredibly wasteful, as it unnecessarily repeats notation. What we could do instead is to create a list which has as many columns as there are unique elements in these equations (since they all have the same structure), and only note the numeric values which actually change. And there you have a matrix: Whilst this is what we will be using matrices for next week, let us leave regression aside for now, and focus on working with matrices more generally. We will now be using these two sample matrices: \\[\\begin{equation*} A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 3\\\\ 9 &amp; 5 &amp; 4\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\hspace{0.75cm} B = \\begin{bmatrix} 6 &amp; 3 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\\\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 3 &amp; 9 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation*}\\] 0.9 Matrix Notation We can refer to individual elements of a matrix by stating the name of the matrix, and then in the index first the row, followed by the column (you might recognise this logic from R – this is because it is the same). With respect to matrix A, for example, the value in the first row and first column (1) would be referred to as \\(A_{11}=1\\) The number in the first row, but second column would be referred to as \\(A_{12}=7\\) 0.10 Calculating with Matrices We will only need to multiply and divide matrices on this module, so let’s cover these operations now. 0.10.1 Multiplying Matrices To show you how this is done, I will multiply matrix A with matrix B and record the results in a new matrix called C. \\[\\begin{equation*} A \\times B = C = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 3\\\\ 9 &amp; 5 &amp; 4\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{bmatrix} 6 &amp; 3 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\\\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 3 &amp; 9 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 30 &amp; 32 &amp; 24 &amp; 51\\\\ 73 &amp; 57 &amp; 89 &amp; 74\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation*}\\] In order to calculate a new element \\(C_{i,j}\\), we multiply the elements of the \\(i^{th}\\) row of A with the elements of the \\(j^{th}\\) column of B. We then add together these so-called inner products in order to arrive at \\(C_{i,j}\\). Let me give you some examples in which I have set the values from matrix A in bold to make the process more transparent. \\(C_{11}=\\textbf{1}\\times6+\\textbf{7}\\times3+\\textbf{3}\\times1=30\\) \\(C_{12}=\\textbf{1}\\times3+\\textbf{7}\\times2+\\textbf{3}\\times5=32\\) \\(C_{21}=\\textbf{9}\\times6+\\textbf{5}\\times3+\\textbf{4}\\times1=73\\) I have prepared a short video taking you through this process step by step. I would encourage you to watch it now. You might have to sign in with your university credentials. 0.10.2 Dividing Matrices In order to be able to divide by an entire matrix, we take its inverse, and then multiply with the inverse. We do the same in the non-matrix world. For example, if we wanted to divide 6 by 3, this is the same as multiplying 6 with \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), the inverse of 3. Sadly, inverting a matrix is not quite as straightforward as this. In fact, it is one of the most challenging operations you can do with a matrix. Luckily, the inversion of a 2 by 2 matrix (which is what we will be using) is still possible without a degree in algebra. The inverse \\(D^{-1}\\) of a 2 by 2 matrix \\(D\\) is defined as \\[\\begin{equation*} D^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{ad-bc} \\begin{bmatrix} d &amp; -b \\\\ -c &amp; a \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}^{-1} \\end{equation*}\\] Thus, to arrive at the inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix, we first have to form the fraction in front of it. This takes as its denominator the difference between the products of the diagonal elements. We also refer to the denominator as the determinant of the matrix. In a second step – now in the matrix itself – we swap a and d, and set a minus sign in front of b and c. Once again, there is a video on this: 0.11 Special Matrices There are two types of matrices we will be using which hold special, useful properties. This is the transpose of a matrix, and the so-called identity matrix. 0.11.1 Transposing Matrices Another important operation is transposing a matrix, which turns rows into columns and columns into rows. We denote a transposed matrix with an apostrophe. Transposing matrix \\(A\\) into matrix \\(A^\\prime\\) gives us: \\[\\begin{equation*} A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 3\\\\ 9 &amp; 5 &amp; 4\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\hspace{0.75cm} A^\\prime = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 9 \\\\ 7 &amp; 5 \\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation*}\\] You guessed it, here is a video on transposing matrices: 0.11.2 The Identity Matrix There is only one last thing left to show you before we can embark on using matrices for deriving and estimating our regression coefficients. And that is the so-called identity matrix \\(I\\). This matrix is always square, has the value 1 on all diagonal elements, and zeros otherwise. If a matrix is multiplied with \\(I\\), we receive the original matrix. For example let \\[\\begin{equation*} I = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation*}\\] If we multiply I with matrix B we receive \\[\\begin{equation*} I \\times B = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{bmatrix} 6 &amp; 3 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\\\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 3 &amp; 9 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 6 &amp; 3 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\\\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 3 &amp; 9 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation*}\\] This feature will be important in the derivation of estimators next week, where we will make use of the fact that a matrix multiplied with its inverse results in an identity matrix. For example \\(A \\times A^{-1} = I\\). You can check this process out in this video: This material is taken from Reiche (forthcoming).↩︎ He is by far my favourite author.
