This replaces the physical worksheets which we work through in seminars for two reasons: it is environmentally friendlier you can copy / paste code directly from the code chunks in this online companion, whereas doing so from a pdf (on Moodle) tends to lead to problems with character encoding. I hope you find this useful!

Can we use continuous variables for cross-tabulations? What are the strengths and weaknesses of cross-tabulations? Why do we calculate the \\(\\chi^2\\)-value as \\(\\chi^{2} = \\Sigma \\frac{(f_{o}-f_{e})^{2}}{f_{e}}\\) ? How does the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution differ ftom the t- and normal distribution? 1.2 Calculations by Hand I have given you an example of a cross-tabulation in the lecture. Consider the following Table: Calculate the Expected Values and fill in the following table: Calculate the \\(\\chi^{2}\\)-value How many degrees of freedom does this table have? Why? Using the \\(\\chi^2\\) Table, what is the p-value? Are mode of transport and year of study independent in the population? 1.3 Cross-Tabulations in R 1.3.1 Data Set We are working with the World Development Indicators this week, data are taken from World Bank (2020) and Marshall &amp; Gurr (2020). Download the data WDI_PO12Q.csv and place it in a new working directory for this week The variables we will be working with today are as follows: 1.3.2 Loading the Data setwd(&quot;~/PO12Q/Seminars/PO12Q_Seminar_Week 1&quot;) wdi &lt;- read.csv(&quot;files/Week 1/WDI_PO12Q.csv&quot;) 1.3.3 Guided Example We are now going to use the WDI, and produce a crosstab of Life expectancy at birth, total (years) by GDP per capita (constant 2010 US$), using the variables and We first need to recode both variables into factor variables, as these are continuous. First up is Recoding: as a refresher from PO11Q, we are specifying the new data frame as the old one, then we add a pipe, and call the function . Therein, we create a new variable called , which will be an ordered factor, cutting the variable at the stated intervals, and labeling these levels accordingly. library(tidyverse) wdi &lt;- wdi %&gt;% mutate(lifecat= ordered( cut(lifeexp, breaks=c(0,77,84), labels=c(&quot;low&quot;,&quot;high&quot;)))) Next up is which we are recoding into a factor variable with three levels: wdi &lt;- wdi %&gt;% mutate(gdpcat= ordered( cut(gdppc, breaks=c(0,3861.5,25260, 150000), labels=c(&quot;low&quot;,&quot;medium&quot;, &quot;high&quot;)))) Let us now see whether the level of GDP has an influence on life expectancy State the null and the alternative hypothesis (directional) Run the cross-tabulation, by calling: wdi_table &lt;- with(wdi, table(gdpcat, lifecat)) wdi_table lifecat gdpcat low high low 69 0 medium 54 16 high 3 27 Now perform a chi-squared test, using the command2 Xsq &lt;- chisq.test(wdi_table, correct=FALSE) Xsq Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test data: wdi_table X-squared = 89.702, df = 2, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 Are the results statistically significant? At what level? Produce the table of expected frequencies, using the command round(Xsq$expected, 2) lifecat gdpcat low high low 51.44 17.56 medium 52.19 17.81 high 22.37 7.63 You can compare that to the observed ones: round(Xsq$observed, 2) lifecat gdpcat low high low 69 0 medium 54 16 high 3 27 You can see that this is identical to producing the cross-tabulation in the first place: wdi_table lifecat gdpcat low high low 69 0 medium 54 16 high 3 27 What have we found out? 1.3.4 Exercises Let us find out whether the completion of primary school influences unemployment rates. State the null and directional alternative hypothesis for this test. Create a new variable primary_fac using the prim_compl variable. Cut it into three categories “low”, “medium”, and “high”, cutting prim_compl at its first quartile, and its mean. Apply the same procedure to unemploy, creating a new variable called unemp_fac. Create a cross-tabulation assessing the dependence of youth unemployment on primary completion rate. unemp_fac. Test whether the dependence is statistically significant. unemp_fac. Repeat steps 1a) to 1e) for two variables of your own choice.

Technically, \\(\\chi^{2}\\) is only an approximation of the hypergeometric distribution which would deliver an exact test. You can get the precise value by applying Yates’ continuity correction with .↩︎ "],["worksheet-week-2.html", "2 Worksheet Week 2 2.1 Self-Assessment Questions3 2.2 Two-Sample Tests in R", " 2 Worksheet Week 2 2.1 Self-Assessment Questions3 Give an example for a two-sample test for a mean. Give an example for a two-sample test for a proportion. Why do we calculate the t-score as \\(t =\\frac{\\text{Estimate of parameter - null hypothesis value of parameter}}{\\text{Standard error of estimate}}\\) ? What is the difference between a t-score and a z-score? What are the strengths and weaknesses of two-sample tests? 2.2 Two-Sample Tests in R 2.2.1 Data Preparation We are working with the World Development Indicators again. Data are taken from World Bank (2020), Boix et al. (2018), and Marshall &amp; Gurr (2020). To save you rooting in your files, here is the codebook (you are welcome): Load the data set The Polity V Score (variable polity5) codes regimes from -10 (indicating perfect autocracy) to +10 (indicating perfect democracy). With the tidyvserse, create a new variable called democracy which codes all countries with a Polity V score lower than +1 as dictatorships, and all countries with a Polity V score from +1 to +10 as democracies. Apply the same procedure to gdp, cutting it at its median into two levels, Developing and Developed, creating a new variable called gdpcat. Last up is the variable gdpgrowth. Create a new variable called growth which divides countries into “slow-growing” and “fast-growing” countries, using the mean as the cut-off point. 2.2.2 Guided Example – Two-Sample Test for a Proportion Let us find out whether a higher proportion of developed countries is democratic than developing countries. State the null hypothesis and the directional alternative hypothesis for this research question. In order to test this hypothesis, we need to first create a cross-tabulation: table(wdi$gdpcat, wdi$politybin) Dictatorship Democracy Developing 21 36 Developed 19 71 We now take the number of observations which are classed as democracies per development status. We also calculate the row totals, as this gives us the total number of developing and developed countries, respectively. Then we are ready to use the prop.test() command, by first specifying the number of countries which are democracies, then the total number of developing and developed countries, then advising R that a correction for small sample sizes is not necessary in our case. Our hypothesis is directional, because we expect a higher proportion of developed countries to be democratic than developing countries. The status Developing is the lower category, and we thus expect this proportion to be smaller, or “less”. We add this to the test function as option alternative = \"less\". prop.test(c(36,71),c(57,90), correct=F, alternative = &quot;less&quot;) 2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction data: c(36, 71) out of c(57, 90) X-squared = 4.3602, df = 1, p-value = 0.01839 alternative hypothesis: less 95 percent confidence interval: -1.00000000 -0.03061662 sample estimates: prop 1 prop 2 0.6315789 0.7888889 Which proportion of developing and developed countries are democratic? Do we verify or falsify our hypothesis at a 95% confidence level? 2.2.3 Exercise – Two-Sample Test for a Proportion Is a higher proportion of fast-growing countries democratic than slow-growing countries? Use a 95% confidence level. 2.2.4 Guided Example – Two-Sample Test for a Mean Now we are interested whether people live longer in developed countries than in developing countries? For this, we use the variable life Once again, state the Null- and the Alternative Hypothesis The t-test assumes an equal variance in both samples, and so we need to test whether this is the case. We will do this with the so-called Levene Test, where: \\(H_{0}\\): The variance among the groups is equal. \\(H_{A}\\): The variance among the groups is not equal. For the Levene test you need the package, where “car” stands for “Companion to Applied Regression”: install.packages(&quot;car&quot;) Now we call the package and perform the test: library(car) leveneTest(wdi$lifeexp ~ wdi$gdpcat) Levene&#39;s Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median) Df F value Pr(&gt;F) group 1 3.7671 0.05395 . 167 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 The result is insignificant, and we therefore accept the null hypothesis. This means that the variance in the two samples is equal. Now we can perform the t-test. We once again specify alternative=\"less\" as an option, due to the same reasoning as before. t.test(lifeexp ~ gdpcat, data=wdi, var.equal = TRUE, alternative=&quot;less&quot;) Two Sample t-test data: lifeexp by gdpcat t = -12.01, df = 167, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Developing and group Developed is less than 0 95 percent confidence interval: -Inf -9.53028 sample estimates: mean in group Developing mean in group Developed 64.65938 75.71177 Can we conclude at a 95% confidence level, that people live longer in developed countries than in developing countries? 2.2.5 Exercise – Two-Sample Test for a Mean Do people live longer under democracies than under dictatorahips (use the politybin variable)? Use a 95% confidence level.
